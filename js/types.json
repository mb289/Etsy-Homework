        "description": "Small snow white cube made from English fine bone china and real gold rims\r\n\r\nHandmade stoneware white cube made out of English fine bone china with very organic rims\r\n\r\nVery thin and delicate with organic rims.\r\n\r\nIt can serve various uses such as holding jewelry or can be used to keep a small flower bouquet as an unusual small vase or just keep it as it is. \r\n\r\n5 cm x 5 cm & 5 cm high approximately.\r\n\r\nAll have a similar finish but due to the thinness of the material at stoneware temperatures, and as each item is handmade, each finish is slightly different.\r\n\r\n*Because of the nature of my work and the material i use it is very unlikely that further copies of this item will be produced in the future.*\r\n\r\n*please note the listing is for one cube only*\r\n\r\nBone China is a porcelaneous body that contains calcium carbonate. This gives the ware strength and whitens it. One difference between porcelain and bone china is the whiteness of bone china.True bone china is almost snow-white. Another is the translucence of bone china: holding it to a light with your hand behind the china should reveal the shadow of your hand. Porcelain will not do so. Bone china was invented in England in the late eighteenth century, and was apparently superior in strength, translucency, thinness, and whiteness to the porcelain then being produced in Europe.If you compare bone china with all other types of porcelain you will notice the difference immediately. The body of most porcelain has an off-white greyish cast, except for some American china which is ivory colored. True bone china is almost snow-white. Bone China is far more expensive than porcelain as it has superior qualities mentioned above.",
